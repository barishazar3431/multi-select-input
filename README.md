## Description

This is a custom multi-select input component developed by me which also fetches data from a back-end api for Rick and Morty characters. You can search through the characters by filtering them and can choose multiple of them at the same time.

Also, it has support for keyboard navigation for going through the list using your keyboard. And it has two reusable custom hooks which are designed by me.
